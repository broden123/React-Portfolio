      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am 24 years old, currently residing in the Austin, Texas area!
        I attended the University of Idaho, where I earned a bachelors of science in biochemistry. <br />
        After spending a few years in a labratory setting, I realized that my passion for coding was outweighing my desire to continue in the biomedical field. <br />
        So, I enrolled in a full-stack devlopment bootcamp in hopes of beginning a career in app development!
